"Valid Anagram

Given two strings s and t, return true if the two strings are anagrams of each other, otherwise return false.

An anagram is a string that contains the exact same characters as another string, but the order of the characters can be different.

Example 1:

Input: s = "racecar", t = "carrace"

Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "jar", t = "jam"

Output: false
Constraints:

1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
s and t consist of lowercase English letters."

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False

        counts, countt = {},{}

        for i in range(len(s)):
            counts[s[i]] = 1+ counts.get(s[i], 0)
            countt[t[i]] = 1+ countt.get(t[i], 0)
        return counts == countt
